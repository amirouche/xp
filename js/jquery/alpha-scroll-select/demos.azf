The widget is not constrained to a particular style:

ⵣlist{
        ⵣitem{ⵣhref{ⵣvar{projectroot}demo/contact-list/}{Contact list}{demo} looks just like its native counterpart}
        ⵣitem{A much more usable ⵣhref{ⵣvar{projectroot}demo/select-a-country/}{country selector}{demo}}
}

You can of course plug it with native html ⵣcode{select} elements and combox box ie. multi-select.
