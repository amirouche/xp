Javascript jQuery plugin that allows to build select widget that can take full advantage of html5 power with a configurable alpha numeric scrollbar widget.

For sure you already met this widget on mobile as a ⵣhref{ⵣvar{root}jQuery/alpha-scroll-select/demo/contact-list/}{contact list}{demo}.

It's really convenient to improve form usability. It can replace select and combobox widget. Have a look at the ⵣhref{ⵣvar{root}jQuery/alpha-scroll-select/demo/select-a-country}{country select widget}{demo}.
